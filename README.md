# Madlibs

Create an app with 2 views. The first view should be embedded within a Navigation Controller. The bar button item should segue to a second view with 4 text fields and a submit button. Upon clicking the button, the app should unwind back to the first view.  

Use the text from the form to populate a MadLibs sentence.
